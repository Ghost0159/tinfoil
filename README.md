## FAQ

Q: Why aren't my shops loaded?

> A: This usually happens when your Switch isn't synced to real time. Please use [switch-time](https://github.com/3096/switch-time) to adjust the time of your Switch. Either that, or the shop you're trying to access might be down.


Q: I can't open Tinfoil.

> A: Make sure that you have the latest [Signature Patches](https://sigmapatches.su/) installed. If you still can't open Tinfoil, try booting with `fusee.bin` instead of Hekate and reinstall Tinfoil.


Q: Network Error 7 occurs when I try to download something.

> A: This is usually due to a poor network connection. If you are using a LAN cable, try reinserting it.
